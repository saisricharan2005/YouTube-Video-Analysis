**YouTube Performance Analysis & Popularity Dashboard Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Power BI, DAX**

An end-to-end data analysis project to identify factors that contribute to a video's popularity and engagement, culminating in an interactive Power BI dashboard for content creators.

**Data Preparation:** Performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and the Pandas library to ensure data integrity and prepare the dataset for visualization.

**Dashboard Development:** Built a dynamic dashboard in Power BI from scratch, featuring KPI cards, slicers, and multiple visuals to analyze relationships between views, likes, categories, and titles.

**Actionable Insights:** Authored complex DAX measures to create metrics like 'Best Day to Post' and 'Controversy Ratio'. The analysis revealed that videos published on weekends and those with non-ALL CAPS titles achieved higher average views, providing a clear, data-driven strategy for content optimization.
